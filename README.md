# OOSE Project

This repository contains the front-end of the Osaka PSD2 Application.

For the OOSE Project, the PSD2 assignment has been assigned to the Osaka development team. This assignment consists of implementing the PSD2 regulations. PSD2 stands for Payment Service Directive 2. This PSD2 regulation makes it possible for account holders to share transactions and the balance of a bank account with a third party. In addition, with PSD2 it is also possible to initiate a payment. With PSD2 the user has the option to indicate which data he / she wants to share or not. The application to be developed by us will use data provided by the PSD2 regulations. In the case of our application, we are this third party.

The client for this assignment is Info Support. Info Support is a company specialized in innovative software solutions for organizations.
